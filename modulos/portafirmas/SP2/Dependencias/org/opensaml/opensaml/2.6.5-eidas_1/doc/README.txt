OpenSAML-J
=============================================

OpenSAML-J is a low-level library that allow developers to work with XML in a
Java beans manner.

OpenSAML-J requires a JAXP 1.3 and DOM Level 3 compliant parser, and this
library assumes the use of Xerces and Xalan for historical reasons. You
may choose to use the built-in parser and transform engine at your own
risk.

The use of JDK 1.6 or higher is required. Older Java versions are not
supported.

OpenSAML-J is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.
